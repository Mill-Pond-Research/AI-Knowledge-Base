## 1. Introduction and Overview

<definition>Cerebrovascular disease</definition> encompasses a group of conditions that affect the blood vessels of the brain and the cerebral circulation. These disorders can lead to various types of strokes, which are acute events resulting in damage to brain tissue due to interrupted blood supply.

### 1.1 Significance in Healthcare

Cerebrovascular disease, particularly stroke, represents a major global health concern. It is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with profound impacts on individuals, families, and healthcare systems. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that stroke is the second leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately 11% of total deaths.

<statistic>
In 2019, there were 12.2 million incident stroke cases, 101 million prevalent stroke cases, 143 million disability-adjusted life years due to stroke, and 6.55 million deaths from stroke worldwide.
</statistic>

### 1.2 Current State of Knowledge

Our understanding of cerebrovascular disease has advanced significantly in recent decades, leading to improved prevention strategies, acute treatments, and rehabilitation techniques. Key areas of current focus include:

1. Precision medicine approaches to stroke prevention and treatment
2. Advanced neuroimaging techniques for early detection and prognosis
3. Neuroprotective and neuroregenerative therapies
4. Telemedicine and mobile health technologies for stroke care
5. Understanding the role of genetics and epigenetics in stroke risk and recovery

### 1.3 Brief History and Major Milestones

The understanding and treatment of cerebrovascular disease have evolved dramatically over time:

- <date>Ancient times</date>: Hippocrates (460-370 BCE) first described the phenomenon of sudden paralysis, which is now recognized as stroke.

- <date>17th century</date>: Johann Jacob Wepfer (1620-1695) identified that hemorrhage in the brain could cause stroke and that carotid artery blockage could lead to apoplexy.

- <date>19th century</date>: Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902) described the mechanism of thromboembolism, a major cause of ischemic stroke.

- <date>1920s</date>: Introduction of cerebral angiography by Ant√≥nio Egas Moniz, allowing visualization of brain blood vessels.

- <date>1950s</date>: Development of carotid endarterectomy for stroke prevention.

- <date>1995</date>: FDA approval of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for acute ischemic stroke treatment, marking a new era in stroke care.

- <date>2015</date>: Multiple clinical trials demonstrate the efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy for large vessel occlusion strokes, revolutionizing acute stroke treatment.

- <date>2019-2024</date>: Advancements in artificial intelligence and big data analytics for stroke prediction, diagnosis, and management.

<theory>
The evolution of cerebrovascular disease understanding and treatment reflects a shift from a fatalistic view of stroke as an untreatable "brain attack" to a modern perspective that emphasizes rapid intervention, specialized care, and personalized rehabilitation strategies.
</theory>

## 2. Anatomy and Physiology

Understanding the anatomy and physiology of the cerebrovascular system is crucial for comprehending the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management of cerebrovascular diseases.

### 2.1 Cerebral Blood Supply

The brain receives its blood supply primarily from two pairs of arteries:

1. <definition>Internal Carotid Arteries</definition>: Supply the anterior portion of the brain.
2. <definition>Vertebral Arteries</definition>: Join to form the basilar artery, supplying the posterior portion of the brain.

These arteries form the <definition>Circle of Willis</definition>, an anastomotic ring at the base of the brain that provides collateral circulation.

<diagram>
[Insert diagram of Circle of Willis here]
</diagram>

#### 2.1.1 Major Cerebral Arteries

1. <definition>Anterior Cerebral Artery (ACA)</definition>: Supplies the medial surface of the frontal and parietal lobes.
2. <definition>Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA)</definition>: The largest branch of the internal carotid artery, supplying most of the lateral surface of the brain.
3. <definition>Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA)</definition>: Supplies the occipital lobe and inferior temporal lobe.

### 2.2 Cerebral Blood Flow Regulation

The brain, which comprises only about 2% of total body weight, receives approximately 15% of cardiac output and consumes about 20% of total body oxygen. This high metabolic demand necessitates tight regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF).

<statistic>
Normal CBF in adults: 50-60 mL/100g of brain tissue/minute
</statistic>

#### 2.2.1 Autoregulation

<definition>Cerebral autoregulation</definition> is the intrinsic ability of the brain's blood vessels to maintain constant cerebral blood flow despite changes in systemic blood pressure. This mechanism operates effectively when mean arterial pressure (MAP) is between 60-150 mmHg.

<theory>
Myogenic, neurogenic, and metabolic mechanisms contribute to cerebral autoregulation, with endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and perivascular nerves playing crucial roles.
</theory>

#### 2.2.2 Neurovascular Coupling

<definition>Neurovascular coupling</definition> refers to the relationship between local neuronal activity and subsequent changes in cerebral blood flow. This mechanism ensures that active brain regions receive an adequate blood supply.

Key mediators of neurovascular coupling include:
- Nitric oxide (NO)
- Prostaglandins
- Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs)
- Potassium ions

### 2.3 Blood-Brain Barrier

The <definition>blood-brain barrier (BBB)</definition> is a highly selective semipermeable border that separates the circulating blood from the brain extracellular fluid. It plays a crucial role in brain homeostasis and protection against pathogens and toxins.

Components of the BBB:
1. Endothelial cells with tight junctions
2. Basement membrane
3. Pericytes
4. Astrocyte end-feet

<theory>
Disruption of the BBB is implicated in various cerebrovascular diseases, including stroke, and may contribute to neuroinflammation and secondary brain injury.
</theory>

### 2.4 Cerebral Microcirculation

The cerebral microcirculation, consisting of arterioles, capillaries, and venules, plays a critical role in regulating local blood flow and maintaining the neuronal microenvironment.

<statistic>
The human brain contains approximately 400 miles (644 km) of capillaries.
</statistic>

Key features of cerebral microcirculation:
1. High capillary density
2. Short intercapillary distances
3. Presence of pericytes with contractile properties
4. Glial-vascular interactions

### 2.5 Venous Drainage

Cerebral venous drainage occurs through a network of superficial and deep veins that ultimately drain into the dural venous sinuses.

Major dural venous sinuses:
1. Superior sagittal sinus
2. Inferior sagittal sinus
3. Straight sinus
4. Transverse sinuses
5. Sigmoid sinuses

<theory>
Impaired venous drainage can lead to cerebral venous thrombosis, a less common but important cause of stroke, particularly in younger individuals and specific patient populations.
</theory>

### 2.6 Anatomical Variations

It's important to note that there is considerable variation in cerebrovascular anatomy among individuals. Common variations include:

1. Fetal-type posterior cerebral artery
2. Absence or hypoplasia of the A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery
3. Persistent trigeminal artery
4. Azygos anterior cerebral artery

These variations can influence the presentation and management of cerebrovascular diseases.

Understanding the intricate anatomy and physiology of the cerebrovascular system provides a foundation for comprehending the pathophysiology of stroke and other cerebrovascular disorders. This knowledge is crucial for accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and development of new therapeutic strategies.

## 3. Etiology and Risk Factors

Cerebrovascular disease, particularly stroke, arises from a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Understanding these risk factors is crucial for effective prevention, early intervention, and management strategies.

### 3.1 Known Causes

The two main types of stroke have distinct primary causes:

1. <definition>Ischemic Stroke</definition> (accounts for approximately 87% of all strokes):
   - Thrombosis: Formation of a blood clot within a cerebral blood vessel
   - Embolism: A clot or other debris from elsewhere in the body travels to the brain
   - Systemic hypoperfusion: Reduced blood flow to the brain due to cardiac pump failure or severe blood loss

2. <definition>Hemorrhagic Stroke</definition> (accounts for approximately 13% of all strokes):
   - Intracerebral hemorrhage: Rupture of a blood vessel within the brain tissue
   - Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Bleeding into the space surrounding the brain

### 3.2 Risk Factors

Risk factors for cerebrovascular disease can be categorized as modifiable and non-modifiable:

#### 3.2.1 Non-modifiable Risk Factors

1. <factor>Age</factor>: The risk of stroke doubles for each decade after age 55.
   
   <statistic>
   75% of all strokes occur in people aged 65 and older.
   </statistic>

2. <factor>Sex</factor>: Men have a higher risk of stroke than women at younger ages, but women have a higher lifetime risk.

3. <factor>Race and Ethnicity</factor>: African Americans have nearly twice the risk of first-ever stroke compared to Caucasians.

4. <factor>Family History</factor>: Having a first-degree relative who has had a stroke increases an individual's risk.

5. <factor>Genetic Factors</factor>: Certain genetic disorders, such as CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy), significantly increase stroke risk.

#### 3.2.2 Modifiable Risk Factors

1. <factor>Hypertension</factor>: The single most important modifiable risk factor for stroke.
   
   <statistic>
   Individuals with blood pressure >140/90 mmHg have a 2-4 times higher risk of stroke compared to those with normal blood pressure.
   </statistic>

2. <factor>Smoking</factor>: Increases stroke risk by 2-4 times.

3. <factor>Diabetes Mellitus</factor>: Increases stroke risk by 2-4 times.

4. <factor>Atrial Fibrillation</factor>: Increases stroke risk by 4-5 times.

5. <factor>Dyslipidemia</factor>: High total cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol are associated with increased stroke risk.

6. <factor>Physical Inactivity</factor>: Sedentary individuals have a 50% higher risk of stroke compared to those who engage in regular physical activity.

7. <factor>Obesity</factor>: Particularly abdominal obesity, is associated with increased stroke risk.

8. <factor>Diet</factor>: High salt intake, excessive alcohol consumption, and diets low in fruits and vegetables increase stroke risk.

9. <factor>Stress and Depression</factor>: Chronic stress and depression are associated with increased stroke risk, though the mechanisms are not fully understood.

### 3.3 Prevalence and Incidence

<statistic>
Global stroke incidence: Approximately 13.7 million new strokes occur worldwide each year.
Global stroke prevalence: About 101 million people worldwide are living with the effects of stroke.
</statistic>

[Source: Global Burden of Disease Study 2019]

Regional variations in stroke incidence and prevalence are significant:

- <statistic>Highest age-standardized incidence: Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and East Asia</statistic>
- <statistic>Lowest age-standardized incidence: High-income North America, Central Latin America, and Western Europe</statistic>

### 3.4 High-Risk Populations

Certain populations are at higher risk for cerebrovascular disease:

1. <population>Elderly individuals</population>: Risk increases exponentially with age.

2. <population>African Americans</population>: Higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes contributes to increased stroke risk.

3. <population>Individuals with multiple risk factors</population>: The presence of multiple risk factors has a synergistic effect on stroke risk.

4. <population>Patients with previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)</population>: Have a significantly higher risk of recurrent stroke.

5. <population>Individuals with certain genetic disorders</population>: Such as sickle cell disease or CADASIL.

### 3.5 Screening Recommendations

Given the significant impact of modifiable risk factors, screening plays a crucial role in stroke prevention:

1. <recommendation>Blood Pressure Screening</recommendation>: Regular blood pressure checks are recommended for all adults.

2. <recommendation>Lipid Profile</recommendation>: Adults should have their cholesterol levels checked at least every 4-6 years, more frequently for those at higher risk.

3. <recommendation>Diabetes Screening</recommendation>: The American Diabetes Association recommends screening for type 2 diabetes beginning at age 45, or earlier for individuals with risk factors.

4. <recommendation>Atrial Fibrillation Screening</recommendation>: Pulse palpation or ECG rhythm strip is recommended for adults 65 years or older, or those with risk factors.

5. <recommendation>Carotid Artery Screening</recommendation>: Not recommended for the general population but may be considered for individuals with multiple risk factors.

<theory>
The concept of "primordial prevention" has gained traction in recent years, focusing on preventing the development of risk factors in the first place, rather than just managing existing risk factors. This approach emphasizes lifestyle interventions and public health measures starting from early childhood.
</theory>

Understanding the etiology and risk factors of cerebrovascular disease is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies and identifying high-risk individuals who may benefit from more intensive interventions. The complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors underscores the need for a multifaceted approach to stroke prevention and management.

## 4. Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology of cerebrovascular disease, particularly stroke, involves complex mechanisms that lead to disruption of cerebral blood flow and subsequent brain tissue damage. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving patient outcomes.

### 4.1 Ischemic Stroke Pathophysiology

Ischemic stroke, accounting for approximately 87% of all strokes, results from a sudden reduction or cessation of blood flow to a region of the brain.

#### 4.1.1 Ischemic Cascade

The ischemic cascade is a series of biochemical events that occur following the onset of cerebral ischemia:

1. <event>Energy Failure</event>: Reduced blood flow leads to decreased oxygen and glucose supply, resulting in ATP depletion.

2. <event>Ion Pump Failure</event>: ATP depletion causes failure of Na+/K+ ATPase pumps, leading to intracellular sodium accumulation and potassium efflux.

3. <event>Membrane Depolarization</event>: Changes in ion gradients cause neuronal depolarization.

4. <event>Excitotoxicity</event>: Depolarization triggers excessive release of excitatory neurotransmitters, particularly glutamate, leading to NMDA receptor activation and calcium influx.

5. <event>Calcium Overload</event>: Intracellular calcium accumulation activates various enzymes (proteases, lipases, endonucleases) that damage cellular structures.

6. <event>Free Radical Production</event>: Mitochondrial dysfunction and other processes lead to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS).

7. <event>Inflammation</event>: Activation of microglia and astrocytes, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and infiltration of leukocytes contribute to tissue damage.

8. <event>Apoptosis</event>: Programmed cell death pathways are activated, leading to delayed neuronal death.

<theory>
The concept of the "ischemic penumbra" - potentially salvageable tissue surrounding the infarct core - forms the basis for time-sensitive acute stroke interventions. The penumbra may persist for hours after stroke onset, providing a window for therapeutic intervention.
</theory>

#### 4.1.2 Mechanisms of Ischemic Stroke

1. <mechanism>Thrombosis</mechanism>:
   - Large Vessel Thrombosis: Often due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture or endothelial injury.
   - Small Vessel Thrombosis: Typically affects penetrating arteries, leading to lacunar infarcts.

2. <mechanism>Embolism</mechanism>:
   - Cardioembolic: Often due to atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, or recent myocardial infarction.
   - Artery-to-Artery Embolism: Debris from atherosclerotic plaques in large arteries travels to smaller cerebral vessels.

3. <mechanism>Systemic Hypoperfusion</mechanism>: Global reduction in cerebral blood flow, often due to cardiac pump failure or severe blood loss.

### 4.2 Hemorrhagic Stroke Pathophysiology

Hemorrhagic stroke, accounting for approximately 13% of all strokes, results from bleeding into or around the brain.

#### 4.2.1 Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH)

1. <event>Primary Injury</event>: Direct tissue damage and mass effect from the expanding hematoma.

2. <event>Secondary Injury</event>: Occurs in the hours and days following the initial bleed, involving:
   - Hematoma expansion
   - Perihematomal edema
   - Inflammation
   - Blood-brain barrier disruption
   - Oxidative stress

3. <event>Hydrocephalus</event>: May occur due to obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid flow.

#### 4.2.2 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)

1. <event>Initial Bleed</event>: Often due to rupture of an intracranial aneurysm.

2. <event>Early Brain Injury</event>: Occurs within the first 72 hours, involving:
   - Increased intracranial pressure
   - Reduced cerebral blood flow
   - Blood-brain barrier disruption
   - Neuroinflammation

3. <event>Delayed Cerebral Ischemia</event>: Occurs 3-14 days after the initial bleed, often due to vasospasm.

### 4.3 Cerebral Small Vessel Disease

Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is an important cause of stroke, cognitive decline, and age-related disability.

Key pathophysiological features include:
1. Arteriolar wall thickening and stiffening
2. Blood-brain barrier dysfunction
3. Impaired cerebral autoregulation
4. Endothelial dysfunction
5. Inflammation

<theory>
Recent research suggests that CSVD may be a systemic endothelial disorder, with the brain being particularly vulnerable due to its high metabolic demands and unique vascular anatomy.
</theory>

### 4.4 Reperfusion Injury

Paradoxically, the restoration of blood flow to ischemic tissue can exacerbate injury through several mechanisms:

1. <mechanism>Oxidative Stress</mechanism>: Sudden influx of oxygen leads to increased production of reactive oxygen species.

2. <mechanism>Calcium Overload</mechanism>: Reperfusion can cause additional calcium influx into already compromised cells.

3. <mechanism>Inflammation</mechanism>: Reperfusion triggers an inflammatory response, with leukocyte infiltration and release of pro-inflammatory mediators.

4. <mechanism>Microvascular Obstruction</mechanism>: "No-reflow" phenomenon due to microvascular plugging by leukocytes and platelets.

### 4.5 Neuroplasticity and Recovery

Following a stroke, the brain undergoes various adaptive changes in an attempt to recover function:

1. <mechanism>Diaschisis Resolution</mechanism>: Recovery of functionally connected but structurally intact regions remote from the infarct.

2. <mechanism>Peri-infarct Reorganization</mechanism>: Recruitment of adjacent cortical areas to take over functions of the damaged region.

3. <mechanism>Contralateral Hemisphere Compensation</mechanism>: Increased activation of homologous regions in the unaffected hemisphere.

4. <mechanism>Neurogenesis and Angiogenesis</mechanism>: Limited formation of new neurons and blood vessels in response to ischemic injury.

<theory>
The concept of "brain reserve" or "cognitive reserve" suggests that individuals with higher education, cognitive engagement, and brain volume may have greater resilience to the effects of cerebrovascular pathology.
</theory>

Understanding the complex pathophysiology of cerebrovascular disease is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving patient outcomes. Ongoing research continues to uncover new mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets, particularly in areas such as neuroprotection, neuroinflammation modulation, and enhancement of neuroplasticity.

## 5. Clinical Presentation and Symptoms

The clinical presentation of cerebrovascular disease, particularly acute stroke, can vary widely depending on the location and extent of brain tissue affected. Rapid recognition of stroke symptoms is crucial for timely intervention and improved outcomes.

### 5.1 Common Signs and Symptoms

The classic symptoms of stroke are often summarized by the acronym FAST:

- <symptom>F: Face Drooping</symptom> - One side of the face may droop or become numb.
- <symptom>A: Arm Weakness</symptom> - One arm may become weak or numb.
- <symptom>S: Speech Difficulty</symptom> - Speech may become slurred or the person may have trouble speaking or understanding.
- <symptom>T: Time to Call Emergency Services</symptom> - If any of these symptoms are present, even if they resolve, immediate medical attention is crucial.

Additional common symptoms include:

1. <symptom>Sudden onset of numbness or weakness</symptom>, especially on one side of the body
2. <symptom>Sudden confusion</symptom> or trouble understanding speech
3. <symptom>Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes</symptom>
4. <symptom>Sudden trouble walking</symptom>, dizziness, or loss of balance or coordination
5. <symptom>Sudden severe headache</symptom> with no known cause

### 5.2 Typical Patient Presentations

The specific presentation often depends on the vascular territory affected:

#### 5.2.1 Anterior Cerebral Artery (ACA) Territory

- Contralateral leg weakness and sensory loss
- Urinary incontinence
- Behavioral changes (apathy, abulia)
- Impaired judgment and insight

#### 5.2.2 Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) Territory

- Contralateral hemiparesis and hemisensory loss, more severe in face and arm than leg
- Aphasia (if dominant hemisphere affected)
- Neglect and anosognosia (if non-dominant hemisphere affected)
- Homonymous hemianopia

#### 5.2.3 Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA) Territory

- Homonymous hemianopia
- Visual agnosia
- Prosopagnosia (inability to recognize faces)
- Memory impairment (if medial temporal lobe involved)

#### 5.2.4 Vertebrobasilar Territory

- Vertigo, nausea, vomiting
- Diplopia
- Dysarthria
- Ataxia
- Bilateral motor and sensory deficits

#### 5.2.5 Lacunar Syndromes

Small vessel occlusions can lead to specific clinical syndromes:

- Pure motor hemiparesis
- Pure sensory stroke
- Ataxic hemiparesis
- Dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome
- Sensorimotor stroke

### 5.3 Variations in Presentation

#### 5.3.1 Age-related Variations

<theory>
Older adults may present with more subtle or atypical symptoms, such as generalized weakness, altered mental status, or falls, potentially leading to delayed diagnosis.
</theory>

- In patients over 80 years old, the most common stroke symptoms are:
  1. Mental status change (54%)
  2. Difficulty walking (43%)
  3. Hemiparesis (40%)
  4. Dysarthria (34%)

#### 5.3.2 Gender Differences

Women may experience some symptoms more frequently than men:

- Headache
- Altered mental status
- Coma or stupor
- Generalized weakness

#### 5.3.3 Hemorrhagic Stroke Presentation

Hemorrhagic strokes often present with:

- Sudden onset of severe headache ("thunderclap headache")
- Nausea and vomiting
- Altered level of consciousness
- Seizures (more common than in ischemic stroke)

### 5.4 Rare or Atypical Presentations

1. <presentation>Isolated Vertigo</presentation>: May be the sole presentation of a cerebellar or brainstem stroke.

2. <presentation>Alien Hand Syndrome</presentation>: Involuntary movement of one hand, typically seen in anterior cerebral artery strokes.

3. <presentation>Anton's Syndrome</presentation>: Cortical blindness with denial of visual loss, seen in bilateral occipital lobe infarcts.

4. <presentation>Locked-in Syndrome</presentation>: Quadriplegia and anarthria with preserved consciousness, typically due to basilar artery occlusion.

5. <presentation>Top of the Basilar Syndrome</presentation>: Complex constellation of symptoms including visual hallucinations, behavioral abnormalities, and oculomotor disturbances.

### 5.5 Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)

TIAs present with stroke-like symptoms that typically resolve within 24 hours, often much sooner. However, they are important warning signs:

<statistic>
Approximately 10-15% of patients with TIA will have a stroke within 3 months, with half of these occurring within 48 hours.
</statistic>

### 5.6 Stroke Mimics

Several conditions can mimic stroke symptoms, including:

1. Seizures (particularly Todd's paralysis)
2. Complicated migraine
3. Hypoglycemia
4. Brain tumors
5. Multiple sclerosis
6. Conversion disorder

<theory>
The concept of "chameleons and mimics" in stroke diagnosis emphasizes the importance of considering both atypical presentations of true strokes (chameleons) and non-stroke conditions that can mimic stroke symptoms (mimics).
</theory>

### 5.7 Clinical Course

The clinical course of stroke can be highly variable:

1. <course>Acute Phase</course> (first 24-48 hours): Symptoms may fluctuate, with potential for neurological deterioration or improvement.

2. <course>Subacute Phase</course> (days to weeks): Period of relative stability, often with some degree of spontaneous recovery.

3. <course>Chronic Phase</course> (weeks to months): Gradual improvement through rehabilitation, though some deficits may persist.

Understanding the diverse clinical presentations of cerebrovascular disease is crucial for prompt diagnosis and appropriate management. Healthcare providers must be vigilant for both typical and atypical presentations, particularly in high-risk populations. Public education about stroke symptoms, emphasizing the importance of rapid medical attention, remains a key strategy in improving stroke outcomes.

## 6. Diagnostic Approaches

Accurate and timely diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease, particularly acute stroke, is crucial for appropriate management and improved patient outcomes. The diagnostic process involves a combination of clinical assessment, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.

### 6.1 Diagnostic Criteria and Classification Systems

#### 6.1.1 TOAST Classification

The Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification is widely used for categorizing ischemic stroke subtypes:

1. Large-artery atherosclerosis
2. Cardioembolism
3. Small-vessel occlusion (lacunar)
4. Stroke of other determined etiology
5. Stroke of undetermined etiology

#### 6.1.2 ASCOD Phenotyping

The ASCOD (Atherosclerosis, Small-vessel disease, Cardiac pathology, Other causes, Dissection) system provides a more comprehensive approach to stroke etiology:

- Each category is graded 1 (potentially causal), 2 (causality uncertain), or 3 (unlikely causal)
- Allows for recognition of multiple potential causes

#### 6.1.3 Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project (OCSP) Classification

This clinical classification system categorizes strokes based on symptoms and signs:

1. Total Anterior Circulation Syndrome (TACS)
2. Partial Anterior Circulation Syndrome (PACS)
3. Lacunar Syndrome (LACS)
4. Posterior Circulation Syndrome (POCS)

### 6.2 Physical Examination Techniques and Findings

#### 6.2.1 National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)

The NIHSS is a standardized neurological examination used to quantify stroke severity:

- Assesses 11 specific abilities, including level of consciousness, gaze, visual fields, facial palsy, motor arm/leg, ataxia, sensory, language, dysarthria, and extinction/inattention
- Scores range from 0 (no stroke symptoms) to 42 (severe stroke)

<statistic>
An increase of 1 point in the NIHSS score decreases the likelihood of an excellent outcome at 3 months by 17%.
</statistic>

[Source: Adams et al., Neurology, 1999]

#### 6.2.2 Key Physical Examination Findings

1. <finding>Motor Deficits</finding>: Assess strength in all limbs, looking for hemiparesis or hemiplegia
2. <finding>Sensory Deficits</finding>: Check for hemisensory loss
3. <finding>Cranial Nerve Abnormalities</finding>: Assess for facial droop, gaze preference, visual field deficits
4. <finding>Cerebellar Signs</finding>: Look for ataxia, dysmetria, or nystagmus
5. <finding>Language and Speech</finding>: Evaluate for aphasia or dysarthria
6. <finding>Neglect</finding>: Assess for hemispatial neglect or extinction to double simultaneous stimulation

### 6.3 Laboratory Tests and Imaging Studies

#### 6.3.1 Laboratory Tests

Essential laboratory tests in acute stroke evaluation include:

1. Complete blood count (CBC)
2. Coagulation studies (PT, INR, aPTT)
3. Basic metabolic panel
4. Cardiac enzymes (troponin)
5. Blood glucose level
6. Hemoglobin A1c

Additional tests may include:

7. Lipid profile
8. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)
9. Toxicology screen
10. Pregnancy test in women of childbearing age

#### 6.3.2 Imaging Studies

1. <test>Non-contrast CT (NCCT) of the head</test>:
   - First-line imaging modality in suspected acute stroke
   - Rapidly excludes hemorrhage and may show early signs of ischemia

2. <test>CT Angiography (CTA)</test>:
   - Evaluates intracranial and extracranial vasculature
   - Identifies large vessel occlusions and stenoses

3. <test>CT Perfusion (CTP)</test>:
   - Assesses cerebral blood flow, volume, and transit time
   - Helps identify salvageable penumbra in acute ischemic stroke

4. <test>MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)</test>:
   - More sensitive than CT for early detection of ischemic changes
   - DWI can detect ischemic changes within minutes of onset

5. <test>MR Angiography (MRA)</test>:
   - Provides detailed evaluation of intracranial and extracranial vasculature
   - Can be performed without contrast (time-of-flight technique)

6. <test>Carotid Duplex Ultrasonography</test>:
   - Non-invasive assessment of carotid artery stenosis
   - Useful for screening and follow-up

7. <test>Transcranial Doppler (TCD)</test>:
   - Assesses intracranial blood flow velocities
   - Useful for monitoring for vasospasm in subarachnoid hemorrhage

8. <test>Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA)</test>:
   - Gold standard for evaluating intracranial vasculature
   - Typically reserved for cases where non-invasive imaging is inconclusive or when intervention is planned

### 6.4 Differential Diagnoses and Diagnostic Algorithms

#### 6.4.1 Differential Diagnoses

Key differential diagnoses for acute stroke include:

1. Seizure with post-ictal Todd's paralysis
2. Complicated migraine (hemiplegic migraine)
3. Hypoglycemia
4. Brain tumor
5. Multiple sclerosis
6. Conversion disorder
7. Encephalitis
8. Wernicke's encephalopathy
9. Hypertensive encephalopathy
10. Drug toxicity (e.g., lithium)

#### 6.4.2 Diagnostic Algorithm

A typical diagnostic algorithm for suspected acute stroke:

1. Rapid neurological assessment (including NIHSS)
2. Immediate NCCT and CTA
3. Laboratory tests (CBC, coagulation studies, metabolic panel, glucose)
4. If hemorrhage excluded on NCCT:
   - Consider CTP or MRI with DWI if within extended time window for intervention
   - Evaluate for large vessel occlusion on CTA
5. If hemorrhage present:
   - Consider CTA to evaluate for underlying vascular abnormalities

### 9.2 Screening Methods and Guidelines

Screening for stroke risk factors and subclinical cerebrovascular disease can identify individuals who may benefit from more intensive preventive interventions.

#### 9.2.1 Blood Pressure Screening

<guideline>
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for high blood pressure in adults 18 years or older.
</guideline>

- Frequency: Annual screening for adults aged 40 years or older and for those at increased risk; every 3-5 years for adults aged 18-39 years with normal blood pressure

#### 9.2.2 Lipid Screening

<guideline>
The USPSTF recommends lipid screening for adults aged 40-75 years.
</guideline>
