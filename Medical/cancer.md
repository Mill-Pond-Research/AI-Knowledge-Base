## 2. Anatomy and Physiology

Understanding the normal anatomy and physiology of the human body is crucial for comprehending how cancer develops and affects various organ systems. This section will provide an overview of relevant anatomical structures and physiological processes, with a focus on those most commonly affected by cancer.

### 2.1 Cellular Structure and Function

<definition>Cells are the basic structural and functional units of all living organisms.</definition>

Key components of a typical human cell include:

1. Nucleus: Contains genetic material (DNA)
2. Cytoplasm: Gel-like substance where cellular processes occur
3. Cell membrane: Selectively permeable barrier controlling substance entry and exit
4. Mitochondria: Energy-producing organelles
5. Endoplasmic reticulum: Involved in protein and lipid synthesis
6. Golgi apparatus: Modifies, packages, and distributes cellular products
7. Lysosomes: Contain enzymes for breaking down cellular waste

### 2.2 Cell Division and Growth

Normal cell division is a tightly regulated process called the cell cycle, which consists of several phases:

1. G1 phase: Cell growth and preparation for DNA synthesis
2. S phase: DNA replication
3. G2 phase: Preparation for mitosis
4. M phase (Mitosis): Cell division
5. G0 phase: Resting phase (some cells may enter this phase temporarily or permanently)

<definition>Mitosis is the process of cell division resulting in two genetically identical daughter cells.</definition>

Key regulators of the cell cycle include:

- Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)
- Tumor suppressor genes (e.g., p53, Rb)
- Growth factors and their receptors

### 2.3 Tissue Types and Organization

Human tissues are classified into four main types:

1. Epithelial tissue: Forms protective layers and glandular structures
2. Connective tissue: Provides support and connects other tissues
3. Muscle tissue: Enables movement and contraction
4. Nervous tissue: Transmits electrical signals

<example>
Epithelial tissue lines the digestive tract, respiratory system, and forms the outer layer of the skin. Many common cancers, such as carcinomas, originate in epithelial tissues.
</example>

### 2.4 Organ Systems Commonly Affected by Cancer

While cancer can develop in any part of the body, certain organ systems are more frequently affected:

1. Integumentary System (Skin)
   - Largest organ of the body
   - Functions: Protection, temperature regulation, sensation

Key homeostatic mechanisms relevant to cancer include:

1. Cell cycle regulation
2. DNA repair mechanisms
3. Apoptosis (programmed cell death)
4. Immune surveillance

Disruption of these homeostatic mechanisms can contribute to cancer development and progression.

### 2.6 Variations in Anatomy and Physiology

It's important to note that there are variations in anatomy and physiology across different populations:

- Age-related changes: Cellular senescence, decreased organ function
- Sex-specific differences: Hormonal influences, reproductive organ structure
