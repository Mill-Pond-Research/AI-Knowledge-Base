## 1. Introduction and Overview

<definition>Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a chronic medical condition characterized by persistently elevated pressure within the blood vessels.</definition> It is often referred to as the "silent killer" due to its asymptomatic nature in many cases, yet its potential to cause severe damage to various organs and increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

### 1.1 Significance in Healthcare

Hypertension is a major global health concern, affecting an estimated 1.28 billion adults worldwide as of 2019, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Its significance in healthcare stems from several factors:

1. Prevalence: Hypertension is one of the most common chronic diseases globally.
2. Morbidity and mortality: It is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and kidney disease.
3. Economic burden: The cost of treating hypertension and its complications places a significant strain on healthcare systems worldwide.
4. Preventability: Many cases of hypertension can be prevented or managed through lifestyle modifications and appropriate medical interventions.

### 1.2 Current State of Knowledge

Our understanding of hypertension has evolved significantly over the past century. Current knowledge encompasses:

- Detailed mechanisms of blood pressure regulation
- Multiple etiologies and risk factors
- Sophisticated diagnostic techniques
- A wide array of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options
- Recognition of hypertension as part of a broader cardiovascular risk profile

### 1.3 Brief History and Major Milestones

<timeline>
1. 1733: Stephen Hales conducts the first recorded measurement of blood pressure in animals.
2. 1896: Scipione Riva-Rocci invents the modern sphygmomanometer.
3. 1905: Nikolai Korotkoff describes the sounds used in auscultatory blood pressure measurement.
4. 1940s-1950s: Large-scale epidemiological studies, including the Framingham Heart Study, establish hypertension as a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
5. 1967: The first ACE inhibitor is discovered, leading to a new class of antihypertensive medications.
6. 1977: The first report of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure is published, standardizing hypertension management.
7. 2017: American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines redefine hypertension as blood pressure ≥130/80 mmHg.
</timeline>

## 2. Anatomy and Physiology

### 2.1 Cardiovascular System Overview

<anatomy>
The cardiovascular system consists of:
- Heart: A four-chambered pump that circulates blood throughout the body
- Blood vessels: Arteries, veins, and capillaries that form a closed circulatory system
- Blood: The fluid medium that carries oxygen, nutrients, and waste products
</anatomy>

### 2.2 Blood Pressure Regulation

Blood pressure is determined by two primary factors:

1. Cardiac output: The volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute
2. Peripheral vascular resistance: The resistance to blood flow in the blood vessels

<physiology>
Blood pressure regulation involves complex interactions between:
- Nervous system (sympathetic and parasympathetic)
- Endocrine system (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, antidiuretic hormone)
- Renal system (fluid and electrolyte balance)
- Vascular system (endothelial function, vascular smooth muscle)
</physiology>

### 2.3 Normal Blood Pressure Values

According to current guidelines:

| Category | Systolic (mmHg) | Diastolic (mmHg) |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Normal | <120 | and <80 |
| Elevated | 120-129 | and <80 |
| Hypertension Stage 1 | 130-139 | or 80-89 |
| Hypertension Stage 2 | ≥140 | or ≥90 |
| Hypertensive Crisis | >180 | and/or >120 |

### 2.4 Variations in Anatomy and Physiology

Blood pressure regulation can vary across different populations:

- Age: Blood pressure tends to increase with age due to reduced arterial elasticity
- Sex: Men generally have higher blood pressure than premenopausal women
- Race: African Americans have a higher prevalence of hypertension compared to other racial groups
- Body composition: Obesity is associated with higher blood pressure

## 3. Etiology and Risk Factors

### 3.1 Primary (Essential) Hypertension

<definition>Primary hypertension, accounting for 90-95% of cases, has no single identifiable cause but results from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors.</definition>

### 3.2 Secondary Hypertension

<definition>Secondary hypertension, accounting for 5-10% of cases, is caused by an identifiable underlying condition.</definition>

Common causes include:
- Renal diseases (e.g., chronic kidney disease, renal artery stenosis)
- Endocrine disorders (e.g., primary aldosteronism, pheochromocytoma)
- Obstructive sleep apnea
- Coarctation of the aorta
- Medication-induced hypertension

### 3.3 Risk Factors

#### 3.3.1 Non-modifiable Risk Factors
