## 4. Core Theories and Principles

<theories>
1. <theory>Person-Job Fit Theory</theory>

   This theory posits that social behavior is the result of an exchange process. In the context of job interviews, it relates to how candidates and interviewers exchange information and form impressions based on perceived costs and benefits.

5. <theory>Cognitive Load Theory</theory>
   This theory, when applied to interviewing, suggests that the cognitive demands of the interview process can affect a candidate's performance. It informs practices to create fair and effective interview environments.

6. <theory>Attribution Theory</theory>
   This theory deals with how individuals explain the behavior of others. In interviewing, it relates to how interviewers interpret and attribute meaning to candidates' responses and behaviors.
