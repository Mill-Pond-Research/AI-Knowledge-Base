Business strategy is grounded in several fundamental theories and principles that guide strategic thinking and decision-making. This section explores some of the most influential theories that have shaped the field of business strategy.

<business_theories>

1. <business_theory>Porter's Generic Strategies</business_theory>

   </business_description>

6. <business_theory>Stakeholder Theory</business_theory>
   <business_description>
   This theory, developed by R. Edward Freeman, proposes that a company should create value for all stakeholders, not just shareholders. Principles include:
