## 1. Introduction

This knowledge base document is based on a comprehensive paper that explores the rapidly evolving field of prompt design and engineering for large language models (LLMs). The document serves as a practical guide for researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts seeking to harness the potential of LLMs through effective prompt engineering techniques.

### 1.1 What is a prompt?

A prompt in generative AI models is the textual input provided by users to guide the model's output. The paper defines a prompt as follows:

> "A prompt in generative AI models is the textual input provided by users to guide the model's output. This could range from simple questions to detailed descriptions or specific tasks. In the context of image generation models like DALLE-3, prompts are often descriptive, while in LLMs like GPT-4 or Gemini, they can vary from simple queries to complex problem statements."

Prompts generally consist of four main elements:
1. Instructions
2. Questions
3. Input data
4. Examples

The paper notes that to elicit a desired response from an AI model, a prompt must contain either instructions or questions, with other elements being optional.

### 1.2 Basic prompt examples

The paper provides several examples of basic prompts, demonstrating different combinations of prompt elements:

1. Instructions + Question
2. Instructions + Input
3. Question + Examples

For instance, the Instructions + Question example is described as follows:

> "Beyond asking a simple question, possibly the next level of sophistication in a prompt is to include some instructions on how the model should answer the question. Here I ask for advice on how to write a college essay, but also include instructions on the different aspects I am interested to hear about in the answer."

The prompt given is:

> "How should I write my college admission essay? Give me suggestions about the different sections I should include, what tone I should use, and what expressions I should avoid."

## 2. Large Language Models and Their Limitations

The paper discusses several limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), including:

1. Transient State: LLMs lack persistent memory or state.
2. Probabilistic Nature: LLMs introduce variability in responses, even to identical prompts.
3. Outdated Information: LLMs are confined to historical knowledge from pre-training data.
4. Content Fabrication: LLMs may generate plausible yet factually incorrect information, known as "hallucination."
5. Resource Intensity: LLMs require significant computational and financial resources.
6. Domain Specificity: LLMs often require domain-specific data for specialized tasks.

The paper emphasizes the need for advanced prompt engineering techniques to address these limitations:

> "These limitations underscore the need for advanced prompt engineering and specialized techniques to enhance LLM utility and mitigate inherent constraints."

## 3. Advanced Prompt Design Tips and Tricks

The paper introduces several advanced prompt design techniques:

### 3.1 Chain of thought prompting

This technique encourages the model to be factual by forcing it to follow a series of steps in its reasoning. The paper provides an example prompt structure:

> "Original question? Use this format: Q: <repeat_question> A: Let's think step by step. <give_reasoning> Therefore, the answer is <final_answer>."

### 3.2 Encouraging the model to be factual through other means

The paper suggests prompting the model to cite reliable sources:

> "Are mRNA vaccines safe? Answer only using reliable sources and cite those sources."

### 3.3 Explicitly ending the prompt instructions

The paper mentions the use of special tokens to separate instructions from the completion task:

> "GPT based LLMs have a special message <|endofprompt|> that instructs the language model to interpret what comes after the code as a completion task."

### 3.4 Being forceful

The paper notes that forceful language can be effective in prompting:

> "Language models do not always react well to nice, friendly language. If you REALLY want them to follow some instructions, you might want to use forceful language. Believe it or not, all caps and exclamation marks work!"

### 3.5 Use the AI to correct itself

This technique involves asking the model to identify and correct errors in its own output.

### 3.6 Generate different opinions

The paper highlights the ability of LLMs to generate diverse opinions on a topic, which can be useful for brainstorming and understanding different perspectives.

## 4. Advanced Techniques in Prompt Engineering

The paper delves into more sophisticated prompt engineering techniques:

### 4.1 Chain of Thought (CoT)

CoT is described as a significant advancement in harnessing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The paper cites the work by Google researchers:

> "Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models" by Google researchers marks a significant leap in harnessing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).

CoT has two main variants:
1. Zero-Shot CoT
2. Manual CoT

### 4.2 Tree of Thought (ToT)

ToT is presented as an evolution of CoT, allowing for multi-faceted exploration of problem-solving pathways. The paper explains:

> "Central to the ToT approach is the concept of "thought trees," where each branch embodies an alternative reasoning trajectory. This multiplicity allows the LLM to traverse through diverse hypotheses, mirroring the human approach to problem-solving by weighing various scenarios before reaching a consensus on the most likely outcome."

### 4.3 Tools, Connectors, and Skills

The paper discusses the integration of external tools and services with LLMs:

> "Tools, Connectors, and Skills significantly enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). These elements enable LLMs to interact with external data sources and perform specific tasks beyond their inherent capabilities, greatly expanding their functionality and application scope."

### 4.4 Automatic Multi-step Reasoning and Tool-use (ART)

ART is described as a technique that combines automated chain of thought prompting with the use of external tools:

> "ART represents a convergence of multiple prompt engineering strategies, enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle complex tasks that require both reasoning and interaction with external data sources or tools."

### 4.5 Enhancing Reliability through Self-Consistency

The paper introduces the Self-Consistency approach:

> "The essence of Self-Consistency lies in the assumption that the generation of similar responses to a singular prompt by an LLM increases the likelihood of those responses' accuracy."

### 4.6 Reflection

Reflection is presented as a technique for endowing LLMs with the capability for self-improvement:

> "Central to Reflection is the LLM's engagement in an introspective review of its outputs, a process akin to human self-editing, where the model assesses its initial responses for factual accuracy, logical consistency, and overall relevance."

### 4.7 Expert Prompting

The paper describes Expert Prompting as a method to simulate expert-level responses across diverse domains:

> "Expert Prompting, as delineated in contemporary research, represents a novel paradigm in augmenting the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) by endowing them with the capability to simulate expert-level responses across diverse domains."

### 4.8 Streamlining Complex Tasks with Chains

Chains are presented as a transformative approach for leveraging LLMs in complex, multi-step tasks:

> "Chains represent a transformative approach in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex, multi-step tasks. This method, characterized by its sequential linkage of distinct components, each designed to perform a specialized function, facilitates the decomposition of intricate tasks into manageable segments."

### 4.9 Guiding LLM Outputs with Rails

Rails are described as a strategic approach to directing LLM outputs within predefined boundaries:

> "Rails in advanced prompt engineering represent a strategic approach to directing the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs) within predefined boundaries, ensuring their relevance, safety, and factual integrity."

### 4.10 Streamlining Prompt Design with Automatic Prompt Engineering

The paper introduces Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) as a method to automate the prompt creation process:

> "Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) automates the intricate process of prompt creation. By harnessing the LLMs' own capabilities for generating, evaluating, and refining prompts, APE aims to optimize the prompt design process, ensuring higher efficacy and relevance in eliciting desired responses."

## 5. Augmenting LLMs through External Knowledge - RAG

The paper discusses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) as a pivotal innovation for extending LLMs:

> "RAG extends LLMs by dynamically incorporating external knowledge, thereby enriching the model's responses with up-to-date or specialized information not contained within its initial training data."

### 5.1 RAG-aware Prompting Techniques

The paper introduces Forward-looking Active Retrieval Augmented Generation (FLARE):

> "FLARE iteratively enhances LLM outputs by predicting potential content and using these predictions to guide information retrieval. Unlike traditional RAG models, which typically perform a single retrieval step before generation, FLARE engages in a continuous, dynamic retrieval process, ensuring that each segment of the generated content is supported by the most relevant external information."

## 6. LLM Agents
