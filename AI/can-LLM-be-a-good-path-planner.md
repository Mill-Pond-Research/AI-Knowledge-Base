1. Document Overview

This knowledge base entry is based on the research paper titled "Can LLM be a Good Path Planner Based on Prompt Engineering? Mitigating the Hallucination for Path Planning" by Hourui Deng, Hongjie Zhang, Jie Ou, and Chaosheng Feng. The paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in spatial reasoning and path planning, specifically addressing the challenges of spatial hallucination and context inconsistency hallucination in LLMs.

The document presents an innovative approach called Spatial-to-Relational Transformation and Curriculum Q-Learning (S2RCQL) to improve LLMs' performance in maze navigation tasks. This research is significant in the field of artificial intelligence, as it demonstrates a novel method to enhance LLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities, which are crucial for embodied intelligence and various real-world applications.

2. Introduction

The introduction section of the paper sets the context for the research and highlights the current limitations of LLMs in spatial reasoning and long-term planning. The authors state:

"Large language models are remarkable artificial intelligence (AI) technology that has gained remarkable attention in various fields. The LLMs have implemented Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) through massive corpora and advanced transformer frameworks."

However, they also point out the challenges:

"LLMs exhibit significant limitations in spatial reasoning and long-term planning, which caused by their spatial hallucination and context inconsistency hallucination by long-term reasoning."

The authors review existing approaches to address hallucination problems in LLMs, including:

1. Instruction fine-tuning
2. Prompt engineering
3. Reinforcement learning

They note that while these methods have shown promise in various tasks, they still perform poorly in spatial reasoning tasks, particularly maze path planning.

The paper introduces the S2RCQL model as a solution to these challenges, offering three main contributions:

1. The Spatial-to-Relational transformation for converting spatial path planning tasks into entity relations.
2. A path-planning algorithm based on LLMs and reverse curriculum Q-learning to address context inconsistency hallucination.
3. Comprehensive experiments based on the ERNIE-Bot model to verify the reliability and effectiveness of the algorithm.

3. Methodology

3.1 Overview

The S2RCQL methodology comprises three main components:

1. The environment
2. The agent
3. The course module

The authors provide a detailed explanation of the process:

"The agent continuously interacts with the environment, seeking the shortest path from the starting point to the endpoint through trial and error. The environment module declares the maze in text with coordinates, including the maze size, obstacles, starting point, and goal. Then, we extract this format information using LLMs."

They emphasize the use of JSON format for easy parsing:

"To facilitate Python parsing, we control LLM output in JSON format. Moreover, we automatically construct a graph from the JSON response of LLMs to explicitly represent the maze connectivity, facilitating the LLMs' reasoning."

3.2 Spatial-to-Relational Transformation

The Spatial-to-Relational (S2R) transformation is a key innovation in this research. The authors explain:

"We automatically convert map information into an entity relation format, enabling the relevant information required for LLMs' reasoning to be directly presented in the prompt, eliminating spatial hallucination of LLMs."

They provide an example of the transformation:

"This study transforms the coordinates that describe the locations in the maze, such as (1,0) into Node F and (0,0) into Node A. The reachability between coordinates is converted into relationships between nodes. For example, if (1,0) and (0,0) are reachable, it is translated into (A,F), indicating a direct relationship between Node A and Node F."

The authors justify this approach:

"By employing character representations, we can reduce node similarity and focus on relationships rather than node similarity."

3.3 Curriculum Q-Learning

The S2RCQL model incorporates reverse curriculum learning (RCL) and Q-learning to address the context inconsistency hallucination. The authors describe the RCL process:

"The RCL begins by starting from a state close to the goal using random walks to find a reachable initial state X1, which is a simplified task. Then, based on X1, a more challenging initial state, X2, is generated, which continues iteratively."

They explain the integration of Q-learning:

"We used LLMs or hand-crafted method courses to design a staged Q-learning optimization. By starting from a given initial point, we used the Q-learning algorithm to update the Q-table and store the experience data tuple (s, a, r, s′, q) in the experience replay buffer."

The authors provide the action sampling function for Q-learning based on LLMs:

"at = LLMs(st, q_table) if p < (1 − ϵ)
     argmax_a Q(st, a) otherwise"

4. Experiments

4.1 Experiment Settings

The experiments were conducted using Baidu's LLM ERNIE-Bot 4.0. The authors designed mazes of varying sizes:

- 30 with 5 × 5 mazes
- 20 with 7 × 7 mazes
- 10 with 10 × 10 mazes

They compared S2RCQL with several baseline prompt engineering methods:

- Naive
- CoT
- ToT
- ReAct
- Rememberer

The evaluation metrics used were:

1. Success Rate(%): "The ratio of the successful attempts by LLM to reach the target compared with the total number of runs."
2. Optimality Rate(%): "The proportion of getting the shortest path in successful cases."

4.2 Main Results

The main results of the experiments are presented in Table 1 of the paper. The authors highlight:

"Our S2RCQL outperforms the Rememberer algorithm by 25%–40% in terms of Success Rate and 23%–30% in terms of Optimality Rate."

They also note:

"As the maze size increases, the Success Rate and Optimality Rate gradually decline because the maze size determines the search space."

4.3 Ablation Study

The authors conducted an ablation study to verify the effectiveness of different components of their model. They found:

"The results demonstrate that our S2R significantly improves both Success and Optimality rates across various algorithms by mitigating the LLM's spatial hallucination."

When removing the S2R module from S2RCQL:

"The results indicated a decline of approximately 15% in both the Success and Optimality rates."

When removing the CL module:

"The results indicate that the Success and Optimality rates decrease by approximately 20% when there is an absence of curriculum learning. As the maze size increases, the impact of CL becomes more significant."

4.4 Toy Example

The authors provide several case studies to demonstrate the execution process of LLMs in different scenarios. They illustrate common errors and how S2RCQL addresses these issues:

"As demonstrated in Figure 7(a), the agent reaches (2,1) and (2,2) in the prompt engineering. After that, due to spatial hallucination, the direction of action is lost, resulting in an unsolvable result."

"As shown in Figure 7(d), we propose the S2RCQL model to solve this problem. LLMs can accurately navigate to positions they have previously reached (such as point S depicted in Figure 7(d)). This to some extent alleviates the context inconsistency hallucination."

5. Conclusion

The authors conclude by summarizing the main contributions of their research:

"This study proposes the S2RCQL algorithm to improve LLMs' path planning ability by alleviating spatial hallucinations and context inconsistency hallucinations in LLMs. Through S2R, we automatically convert the maze described by coordinates into an entity relation graph structure."

They highlight the generality of their approach:

"The proposed S2R exhibits generality, and its application to various prompt engineering yields significant improvements."

The authors also suggest future research directions:

"In future work, we will research how to enhance LLMs' reverse curriculum generation capabilities."
