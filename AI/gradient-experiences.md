1. Introduction

1.1 The Importance of Prediction
Prediction is posited as a fundamental function of the brain by many prominent neuro- and cognitive scientists. This concept has gained significant traction since the early 2000s, with researchers arguing that prediction is not just a feature but the primary purpose of neural systems.

1.2 Prediction and Movement
<theory>The ability to predict is crucial for survival, particularly in the context of movement. Organisms that can anticipate future states have a significant advantage over those that can only react to current stimuli. This is especially important given the inherent delays in sensory and motor systems.</theory>

1.3 Adaptation and Emergence
<definition>Adaptation: The ability of a system to change in response to (or anticipation of) changes in its environment.</definition>
<definition>Emergence: The process by which complex patterns arise from simpler underlying rules and interactions.</definition>

The book explores how prediction capabilities emerge from simpler neural mechanisms through processes of adaptation and emergence.

1.4 Scope of the Book
"Gradient Expectations" aims to provide a comprehensive overview of prediction in neural systems, covering:
- Conceptual foundations
- Biological implementations
- Artificial neural network models
- Evolutionary perspectives
- Future directions for AI and neuroscience

2. Conceptual Foundations of Prediction

2.1 Basic Elements of Prediction
<definition>Prediction: The process of declaring or indicating a future state in advance.</definition>
Key components of prediction include:
- Comparison between predicted and actual outcomes
- Error calculation and feedback
- Gradient-based adjustments

2.2 Gradients in Prediction
<definition>Gradient: The rate of change of one variable with respect to another.</definition>
Gradients play a crucial role in prediction by providing information about trends and relationships between variables.

2.3 Sequences and Prediction
The ability to predict sequences is a fundamental aspect of cognition. This involves:
- Pattern recognition
- Extrapolation
- Abstraction through averaging

2.4 Control and Prediction
The book draws parallels between prediction and control theory, highlighting similarities in:
- Error calculation
- Feedback mechanisms
- System adjustments

2.5 Predictive Coding
<definition>Predictive Coding: A theory proposing that the brain constantly generates and updates predictions about sensory inputs, only propagating prediction errors.</definition>
This concept is central to many modern theories of brain function and is explored in depth throughout the book.

3. Biological Foundations of Prediction
