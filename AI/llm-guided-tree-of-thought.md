## 1. Document Overview

This knowledge base entry is based on the paper "Large Language Model Guided Tree-of-Thought" by Jieyi Long from Theta Labs, Inc. The document introduces a novel approach called the Tree-of-Thought (ToT) framework, which aims to enhance the problem-solving capabilities of auto-regressive large language models (LLMs). The paper presents the theoretical foundation, implementation details, and experimental results of the ToT framework, focusing on its application to Sudoku puzzle solving as a case study.

The significance of this work lies in its potential to overcome some of the limitations of current LLMs, particularly in tasks requiring long-range reasoning and complex problem-solving. By introducing a tree-like thought process and the ability to backtrack, the ToT framework mimics human problem-solving strategies more closely than traditional LLM approaches.

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Background

The paper begins by acknowledging the recent advancements in self-attention based auto-regressive large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. These models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks, including logical and mathematical reasoning, particularly those involving "short-range reasonings" that require only a few steps to reach conclusions.

<quote>Self-attention based auto-regressive large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have recently taken the world by storm [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. These LLMs excel at a variety of tasks that previously thought as extremely difficult or even impossible.</quote>

However, the author notes that current LLMs still face limitations in certain domains, especially for "long-range" reasoning tasks that require long-term planning and solution exploration.

### 2.2 Motivation

The author identifies two main factors limiting the problem-solving ability of LLMs:

1. Lack of correctness checking: 
<quote>To ensure correctness, a good practice for a human solver is to carry out verification procedures at every step of the problem-solving process, thereby ensuring the credibility of the final solution. In comparison, auto-regressive language models do not explicitly perform logical correctness checks as it generates a new token based on the previous tokens.</quote>

2. Solution generated linearly:
<quote>As mentioned above, LLMs typically generate a token based on the preceding sequence of tokens without backward editing. On the contrary, when a human solver attempts to solve a problem, she might backtrack to previous steps if a derivation step is incorrect, or if she becomes stuck and is unable to make further progress towards arriving at the final answer.</quote>

These limitations inspired the development of the Tree-of-Thought framework, which aims to address these issues by introducing a more human-like problem-solving approach.

## 3. Tree-of-Thought (ToT) Framework

### 3.1 Concept and Inspiration

The Tree-of-Thought framework is inspired by the human mind's approach to solving complex reasoning tasks through trial and error. It explores the solution space through a tree-like thought process, allowing for backtracking when necessary.

<quote>The ToT technique is inspired by the human mind's approach for solving complex reasoning tasks through trial and error. In this process, the human mind explores the solution space through a tree-like thought process, allowing for backtracking when necessary.</quote>

The author draws inspiration from the problem-solving experience shared by Fields Medal winner Terence Tao:

<quote>Fields Medal winner Terence Tao once shared his experiences solving hard math problems: "When I was a kid, I had a romanticized notion of mathematics, that hard problems were solved in Eureka moments of inspiration... With me, it's always, Let's try this. That gets me part of the way, or that doesn't work. Now let's try this. Oh, there's a little shortcut here... You work on it long enough and you happen to make progress towards a hard problem by a back door at some point. At the end, it's usually, oh, I've solved the problem."</quote>

This description highlights the non-linear, exploratory nature of human problem-solving, which the ToT framework aims to emulate.

### 3.2 Key Components

The ToT framework augments an LLM with additional modules to implement this tree-like thought process:

1. Prompter agent
2. Checker module
3. Memory module
4. ToT controller

<quote>To implement ToT as a software system, we augment an LLM with additional modules including a prompter agent, a checker module, a memory module, and a ToT controller.</quote>

These components work together to engage in a multi-round conversation with the LLM, allowing for backtracking and exploration of different solution paths.

## 4. Implementation of ToT Framework

### 4.1 Software System Architecture

The ToT framework is implemented as a software system that enhances the problem-solving capability of an LLM. Figure 1b in the paper illustrates this architecture.

<quote>Figure 1b depicts the software system that implements the ToT Framework. As mentioned earlier, it incorporates several components which enhance the problem solving capability of the LLM, including a prompter agent, a checker module, a memory module, and a ToT controller.</quote>

The problem-solving process using the ToT system follows these steps:

1. User inputs the problem description.
2. The prompter agent relays the problem to the LLM with additional prompts.
3. The LLM generates an intermediate solution.
4. The checker module verifies the validity of the intermediate solution.
5. If valid, the solution is stored in the memory module.
6. The prompter agent generates the next prompt based on the memory content.
7. If invalid, the ToT controller activates the prompter to offer hints and request reconsideration.
8. The ToT controller monitors the process and decides whether to continue or backtrack.

This process continues until a full solution is found or a maximum number of conversation rounds is reached.

### 4.2 ToT Modules

The paper provides detailed descriptions of each module in the ToT system:

1. Checker Module:
   - Can be rule-based or implemented as a deep neural network.
   - For NP problems with polynomial-time checking algorithms, rule-based checkers can be implemented.
   - For more complex problems, neural network-based classifiers can be used.

2. Memory Module:
   - Stores the entire conversation history between the LLM and the prompter agent.
   - Stores supplemental data useful for problem-solving.
   - Serves as an information source for the prompter agent to generate helpful hints.

3. ToT Controller:
   - Oversees the entire ToT search process.
   - Can be implemented with simple rules or as a more advanced policy network.
   - Makes decisions on when to backtrack or continue exploring the current solution path.

4. Prompter Agent:
   - Generates prompts for the LLM based on the current state of the problem-solving process.
   - Can use templates and in-context learning examples to guide the LLM.
   - Can be implemented as a policy network to select the most appropriate prompts.

The paper also describes training algorithms for the ToT controller and prompter agent policy networks using reinforcement learning techniques.

## 5. Evaluation Methodology

### 5.1 ToT Solver for Sudoku Puzzles

To evaluate the effectiveness of the ToT framework, the authors implemented a ToT-based solver for Sudoku puzzles. They chose Sudoku as a case study because:

<quote>At the first glance, Sudoku problems seem to be just brain teasers with little practical importance. However, the generalized Sudoku problem on n^2 × n^2 grids of n × n blocks is known to be NP-complete [33]. If the ToT framework can solve instances of the generalized Sudoku problem (granted that it might takes an exponential number of rounds of conversations), in principle it can handle many other mathematical and logical reasoning tasks.</quote>

The implementation details of the Sudoku solver include:

- Use of the "gpt-3.5-turbo" model accessible through the OpenAI API suite.
- A rule-based checker module for verifying Sudoku rules.
- A memory module storing conversation history and a search tree of partially filled Sudoku boards.
- A rule-based ToT controller for backtracking decisions.
- A prompter agent using a variation of a generic template for generating prompts.

### 5.2 Experimental Results

The authors compared four LLM-based Sudoku puzzle solvers:

1. Zero-shot solver (zs)
2. One-shot solver (os)
3. Few-shot solver (fs)
4. Tree-of-Thought solver (tot)

They constructed three benchmarks comprising ten 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 Sudoku puzzles each. The results are presented in Figure 2 of the paper, which shows the success rates of different solvers across the three benchmarks.

Key findings include:

- The ToT-based solver demonstrated superior performance compared to other solvers.
- For 3x3 puzzles, the ToT solver achieved a 100% success rate.
- For 4x4 puzzles, the ToT solver had an 80% success rate, significantly higher than one-shot and few-shot solvers.
- For 5x5 puzzles, the ToT solver achieved a 60% higher success rate compared to one-shot and few-shot solvers.

<quote>As expected, the zero-shot solver has the worst performance across all the three set of benchmarks. Adding CoT-style step-by-step examples significantly boosts the success rate, especially for the 3x3 puzzles. This is expected, since one can pretty much rely on "short-range" reasoning skills, which is a strength of the LLM models, to solve a small-sized 3x3 Sudoku puzzle, espcially when CoT-style hints are provided. However, as the puzzle size gets bigger, the success rate of the one-shot and few-shot solver dropped to around 0.5. This is because solving bigger puzzles requires trial and error, which is a capability LLMs generally lack of as discussed earlier. In comparison, the ToT-based solver demonstrates superior performance when compared to the other solvers.</quote>

## 6. Discussion and Future Work

The authors acknowledge some limitations of their current implementation and suggest several directions for future work:

1. Generalization to other problems:
<quote>One of the limitations of the current implementation is that it utilizes a rule-based checker that contains custom logic, making it less easily adaptable to other problems. For more generic problems, for example, general mathematical and logical reasoning problems, where rule-based solution checking is difficult to implement, a future direction is to explore checkers based on neural network or other probabilistic models.</quote>

2. Improving the ToT controller:
<quote>Moreover, the experiments we conducted in this work also uses a rule-based ToT controller, which as we pointed out, has limited capabilities. In the future, we will implement the neural network based ToT controller which can hopefully enhance the system performance.</quote>

3. Advanced training algorithms:
<quote>Additionally, the policy-gradient based training algorithm proposed in this work is relatively simple and may be susceptible to training stability issues. To further optimize the ToT system, more advanced multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly those designed for cooperative agents, could be adopted.</quote>

4. Self-play technique:
<quote>Another intriguing future direction is to investigate the potential of utilizing the "self-play" technique to enable the ToT system to develop novel problem solving strategies that are not found in the LLM's training text corpus.</quote>

The authors suggest that a self-play approach, similar to that used in training game-playing AI like AlphaGo, could potentially allow the ToT system to discover novel problem-solving strategies beyond those present in the LLM's training data.
