## Key Sections

### MegaAgent Workflow

The MegaAgent system begins by accepting a prompt, which is then automatically divided into tasks for multiple agent groups. The workflow is as follows:

1. **Query Input**: The process starts with a query that is input into the system.
2. **Multi-level Task Splitting**: The query is split into multiple tasks across different levels.
3. **OS Agent Monitoring**: The OS Agent monitors the progress of the tasks as they are processed by different agent groups.
4. **Action Module Interaction**: The Action Module interacts with the Storage Module through a data retriever to manage and store the results of the tasks.

### Action Module

The Action Module is responsible for executing tasks across different levels, with each level containing multiple agent groups. The structure is as follows:

- **Level 1**: Admin agents (Admin 1, Admin 2, Admin 3, etc.) are responsible for overseeing the tasks.
- **Level 2**: Monitor agents (Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, etc.) supervise the task execution.
- **Level 3**: Specific agent groups (e.g., Group 2_2) handle detailed task execution, with prompts guiding their actions.
- **Level 4**: Subgroups (e.g., Group 2_2_1) perform the most granular tasks, with data retrievers facilitating data access and storage.

### Storage Module

The Storage Module manages the storage and retrieval of data throughout the task execution process. It includes the following components:

- **Log (Serialized)**: Stores serialized logs of the tasks.
- **Memory Database**: Acts as a temporary storage for task-related data.
- **Task Monitor**: Keeps track of the progress and status of tasks.
- **Interactive Python Execution**: Allows for the execution of Python scripts as part of the task processing.
- **Files**: Manages file storage and retrieval.
- **Checklist**: Ensures that all tasks are completed according to the specified requirements.

### Function Calls

MegaAgent supports a variety of function calls to facilitate task execution. These include:

- **read_file**: Reads data from a file.
- **write_file**: Writes data to a file.
- **exec_python**: Executes a Python script.
- **python_input**: Handles input for Python scripts.
- **add_agent**: Adds a new agent to the system.
- **talk**: Facilitates communication between agents.

## Terminology and Definitions

- **LLM-MA (Large Language Model - Multi-Agent)**: A system that uses multiple AI agents to process tasks in parallel, often leveraging large language models for complex decision-making.
- **OS Agent**: The operating system-level agent responsible for monitoring the overall progress of tasks within the MegaAgent system.
- **Admin Agent**: High-level agents responsible for overseeing and managing the execution of tasks across different levels.
- **Data Retriever**: A component that facilitates the retrieval of data from the Storage Module for use in task execution.

## Core Concepts and Principles

### Multi-Level Task Splitting

The principle of multi-level task splitting involves breaking down a complex query into smaller, manageable tasks that can be processed in parallel by different agent groups. This approach allows for efficient handling of large-scale tasks and ensures that each component of the task is addressed by the most appropriate agent group.

### Parallelism and Scalability

MegaAgent is designed to handle tasks in parallel, allowing for significant scalability. By distributing tasks across multiple levels and agent groups, the system can efficiently manage large volumes of data and complex processes without bottlenecks.

---

## Frameworks and Models

### MegaAgent Framework

The MegaAgent framework is built on the concept of multi-agent collaboration, where different agents are assigned specific roles and responsibilities. The framework is designed to be flexible, allowing for the addition of new agents and the customization of task execution processes.

### Comparison with Other LLM-MA Systems

The image includes a comparison table that highlights the differences between MegaAgent and other popular LLM-MA systems:
