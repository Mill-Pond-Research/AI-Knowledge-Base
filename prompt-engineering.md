</theory>

## 5. Critical Frameworks and Models

<framework name="CRISPE Framework">
The CRISPE framework, developed by prompt engineering expert Ethan Mollick, provides a structured approach to crafting effective prompts:

- C: Capacity (Specify the role or expertise the AI should assume)
- R: Request (Clearly state the task or question)
- I: Input (Provide necessary context or information)
- S: Specific Instructions (Offer detailed guidance on how to approach the task)
- P: Personality (Define the tone or style of the response)
- E: Examples (Include sample outputs or demonstrations)

This framework helps users create comprehensive and well-structured prompts that maximize the AI's performance.
</framework>

<framework name="ICE Approach">
The ICE approach focuses on three key elements for effective prompt engineering:

- Context: Relevant background information or constraints
- Examples: Demonstrations of desired outputs or reasoning processes

This simplified framework is particularly useful for beginners in prompt engineering.
</framework>

<model name="Few-Shot Prompting Model">
Few-shot prompting involves providing the AI with a small number of examples within the prompt to guide its performance on a new task. This model is particularly effective for specialized or domain-specific tasks where the AI may not have extensive prior training.

Example structure:
```
Task: [Description of the task]
Example 1:
Input: [Sample input]
Output: [Desired output]
Example 2:
Input: [Sample input]
Output: [Desired output]
Now, complete the following:
Input: [Actual input for the desired task]
Output:
```
</model>

<model name="Chain-of-Thought Prompting">
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting encourages the AI to break down complex problems into step-by-step reasoning processes. This model is particularly effective for tasks requiring logical reasoning or multi-step problem-solving.

Example structure:
```
Problem: [Description of the complex problem]
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) [First step in the reasoning process]
2) [Second step in the reasoning process]
3) [Third step in the reasoning process]
...
Therefore, the solution is: [Final answer or conclusion]
```
