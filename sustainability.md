## 1. Introduction and Overview

<introduction>
Sustainability is a multifaceted concept that has gained significant traction in recent decades. It encompasses the idea of meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This concept extends beyond environmental concerns to include economic and social dimensions, forming what is known as the "triple bottom line" of sustainability.
</introduction>

The significance of sustainability in today's world cannot be overstated. It serves as a guiding principle for:
- Addressing global challenges such as climate change, resource depletion, and social inequality
- Shaping business strategies and government policies
- Influencing consumer behavior and lifestyle choices
- Driving innovation in technology and practices across various sectors
</significance>

5. Environmental Movement (1960s-1980s):
   - First Earth Day celebrated in 1970
   - Formation of environmental protection agencies and regulations
   - Club of Rome's "Limits to Growth" report (1972) highlighted the dangers of unchecked economic growth

6. Sustainable Development Era (1980s-2000s):
   - Brundtland Report (1987) introduced the modern concept of sustainable development
   - United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (Earth Summit) in Rio de Janeiro (1992)
   - Kyoto Protocol (1997) set international targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
