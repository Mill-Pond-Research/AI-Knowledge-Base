## 4. Core Theories and Principles

<theories>
1. <theory>Triple Constraint Theory</theory>
   The Triple Constraint, also known as the Iron Triangle, posits that project success is bound by three interdependent constraints: scope, time, and cost. Any change in one constraint affects the others.

2. <theory>Theory of Constraints (TOC)</theory>
   Developed by Eliyahu M. Goldratt, TOC focuses on identifying and managing the most significant limiting factor (constraint) that stands in the way of achieving a goal.

3. <theory>Stakeholder Theory</theory>
   This theory emphasizes the importance of considering and managing the interests of all project stakeholders, not just the primary sponsors or customers.

4. <theory>Contingency Theory</theory>
   Suggests that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to project management, and the most effective management style depends on the specific situation and context of the project.
</theories>

<principles>
1. <principle>Clear Objectives</principle>
   Establish well-defined, measurable, and achievable project goals and objectives.

2. <principle>Stakeholder Engagement</principle>
