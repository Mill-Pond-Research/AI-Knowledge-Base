4. <business_theory>Consideration Doctrine: The principle that a contract must involve an exchange of something of value between the parties to be legally binding.</business_theory>

5. <business_theory>Capacity to Contract: The principle that parties entering into a contract must have the legal ability to do so, which can be affected by factors such as age, mental state, and authority.</business_theory>
