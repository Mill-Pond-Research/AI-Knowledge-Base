## 1. Introduction and Overview

<introduction>
Business Continuity Planning (BCP) is a proactive process that helps organizations prepare for, respond to, and recover from potential disruptions to their operations. It encompasses a wide range of activities designed to ensure that critical business functions can continue during and after a crisis or disaster. BCP is an essential component of organizational resilience, risk management, and strategic planning.

3. Protect brand reputation
4. Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements
5. Enhance organizational resilience
6. Improve decision-making during crises
7. Reduce recovery time after incidents
</significance>

<relevance>
In today's interconnected and volatile business environment, BCP has become increasingly relevant. Factors contributing to its importance include:
- Globalization and complex supply chains
