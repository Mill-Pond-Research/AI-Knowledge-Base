### Definition and Scope

<business_definition>
Operations Management (OM) is the administration of business practices to create the highest level of efficiency possible within an organization. It involves planning, organizing, and overseeing the organization's processes to balance revenues and costs and achieve the highest possible operating profit.
</business_definition>

Operations management transforms various inputs (raw materials, labor, information, and financial resources) into outputs (products and services) that provide value to customers. This transformation process is central to all organizational activities and spans across various industries, from manufacturing to services.
