1. Metacognitive CQ: The mental processes used to acquire and understand cultural knowledge.
2. Cognitive CQ: Knowledge of cultural norms, practices, and conventions.
3. Motivational CQ: The capability to direct attention and energy toward learning about and functioning in culturally diverse situations.
4. Behavioral CQ: The capability to exhibit appropriate verbal and nonverbal actions when interacting with people from different cultures.

This model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and developing cultural intelligence in business settings.
</business_theory>

### 4.2 Cultural Dimensions Theory

<business_theory>
Geert Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Theory identifies six dimensions along which national cultures can be analyzed:

1. Power Distance Index (PDI)
2. Individualism vs. Collectivism (IDV)
3. Masculinity vs. Femininity (MAS)
4. Uncertainty Avoidance Index (UAI)
5. Long-Term Orientation vs. Short-Term Normative Orientation (LTO)
6. Indulgence vs. Restraint (IND)

Understanding these dimensions helps business professionals anticipate and navigate cultural differences in various business contexts.
</business_theory>

### 4.3 The Cultural Intelligence Scale (CQS)

<business_principle>
The Cultural Intelligence Scale is a psychometric assessment tool designed to measure an individual's cultural intelligence. It evaluates the four factors of CQ (metacognitive, cognitive, motivational, and behavioral) through a series of questions. The CQS is widely used in business for:
