## 4. Core Theories and Principles

<theory name="Nash Equilibrium">
Developed by John Nash in 1950, Nash Equilibrium is a fundamental concept in game theory.

Key principles:
1. Each player's strategy is optimal, given the strategies of all other players.
2. No player can unilaterally improve their payoff by changing their strategy.
3. It represents a stable state where no player has an incentive to deviate from their chosen strategy.

Implications:
- Provides a solution concept for non-cooperative games
- Multiple Nash equilibria can exist in a single game
- Not all Nash equilibria are efficient or desirable outcomes

Example: The Prisoner's Dilemma
In this classic game, two suspects are interrogated separately. Each has the option to confess or remain silent. The Nash Equilibrium is for both to confess, even though mutual silence would lead to a better outcome for both.
</theory>

<theory name="Minimax Theorem">
Developed by John von Neumann in 1928, the Minimax Theorem applies to two-person zero-sum games.

Key principles:
1. In a zero-sum game, one player's gain is exactly balanced by the other player's loss.
2. The minimax strategy minimizes the maximum possible loss.
3. The maximin strategy maximizes the minimum possible gain.
4. In a two-person zero-sum game, the minimax and maximin strategies coincide at the game's value.

Implications:
- Provides a solution concept for strictly competitive situations
- Forms the basis for many algorithms in artificial intelligence and decision theory
- Demonstrates the existence of mixed strategy equilibria in zero-sum games

Example: Rock-Paper-Scissors
In this game, the minimax strategy is to play each option with equal probability (1/3), which guarantees an expected payoff of zero against any opponent strategy.
</theory>

<theory name="Evolutionary Game Theory">
Developed primarily by John Maynard Smith in the 1970s, Evolutionary Game Theory applies game theory to evolving populations in biology.

Key principles:
1. Strategies are considered as inherited traits.
2. Payoffs represent fitness or reproductive success.
3. The concept of Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) is central.
4. Population dynamics are modeled using replicator equations.

Implications:
- Explains the evolution of behaviors in biological populations
- Provides insights into the stability of social norms and conventions
- Bridges game theory with evolutionary biology and population genetics

Example: Hawk-Dove Game
This game models conflict over a shared resource. "Hawk" (aggressive) and "Dove" (passive) strategies can coexist in a stable equilibrium, reflecting the balance of aggressive and peaceful behaviors in nature.
</theory>

<principle name="Backward Induction">
Backward induction is a method of analyzing sequential games, working backwards from the end of the game to determine optimal strategies.

Key aspects:
1. Start at the final decision node and work backwards.
2. At each decision node, assume the player will choose the action that maximizes their payoff.
3. Continue this process until reaching the start of the game.

Applications:
- Solving extensive form games with perfect information
- Analyzing strategic decision-making in multi-stage interactions
- Proving the existence of subgame perfect equilibria

Example: Centipede Game
In this sequential game, two players take turns deciding whether to "take" a larger share of an increasing pot or "pass" to the other player. Backward induction predicts that the first player will "take" immediately, though this often contradicts observed behavior.
</principle>

<principle name="Dominant Strategy">
A dominant strategy is one that provides a higher payoff for a player than any other strategy, regardless of what other players do.

Key aspects:
1. Strictly dominant strategy: Always provides a strictly higher payoff
2. Weakly dominant strategy: Provides at least as high a payoff, and sometimes higher
3. If a dominant strategy exists, it should always be played

Applications:
- Simplifying complex strategic situations
- Predicting behavior in non-cooperative games
- Designing incentive-compatible mechanisms

Example: Prisoner's Dilemma
In the Prisoner's Dilemma, confessing is a dominant strategy for both players, even though mutual cooperation would lead to a better outcome for both.
</principle>

## 5. Critical Frameworks and Models

<framework name="Extensive Form Games">
Extensive form games represent sequential decision-making scenarios as game trees.

Components:
1. Nodes: Represent points where players make decisions or chance events occur
2. Edges: Represent possible actions or outcomes
3. Information sets: Group nodes where a player cannot distinguish between positions
4. Payoffs: Assigned to terminal nodes, representing the outcome for each player

Applications:
- Modeling complex multi-stage interactions
- Analyzing games with imperfect information
- Studying strategic behavior in dynamic settings

Example: Chess
Chess can be represented as an extensive form game, although the game tree is extremely large. Each node represents a board position, and edges represent possible moves.
</framework>

<framework name="Normal Form Games">
Normal form games, also known as strategic form games, represent simultaneous-move games as matrices.

Components:
1. Players: Listed along the dimensions of the matrix
2. Strategies: Represented as rows and columns
3. Payoffs: Entries in the matrix cells, typically ordered by player

Applications:
- Analyzing simultaneous-move games
- Identifying dominant strategies and Nash equilibria
- Studying mixed strategy equilibria

Example: Prisoner's Dilemma
The Prisoner's Dilemma is often represented in normal form, with a 2x2 matrix showing payoffs for each combination of "Confess" and "Remain Silent" strategies.
</framework>

<model name="Repeated Games">
Repeated games model situations where players interact multiple times in the same strategic setting.

Key concepts:
1. Finite vs. Infinite repetition
2. Discounting factor: Represents the relative importance of future payoffs
3. Folk theorem: Describes the set of possible equilibrium payoffs in infinitely repeated games
4. Trigger strategies: Strategies that punish deviations from cooperative behavior

Applications:
- Studying the emergence of cooperation in long-term interactions
- Analyzing reputation effects in repeated transactions
- Modeling dynamic competition in industrial organization

Example: Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
In this repeated version of the Prisoner's Dilemma, cooperative strategies like Tit-for-Tat can emerge as equilibria, unlike in the one-shot game.
</model>

<model name="Cooperative Games">
Cooperative games focus on how groups of players (coalitions) can generate and divide value through collaboration.

Key concepts:
1. Characteristic function: Specifies the value that each coalition can generate
2. Core: Set of allocations that no coalition can improve upon by acting alone
3. Shapley value: A method for fair allocation of value among players
4. Nucleolus: Another solution concept for fair allocation

Applications:
- Analyzing coalition formation in politics and business
- Studying fair division problems
- Modeling collaborative decision-making in organizations

Example: Airport Game
In this game, players (cities) with different sized planes must allocate the cost of building a runway. The Shapley value provides a fair cost allocation based on each city's contribution to the required runway length.

- Each country has an incentive to exceed its quota, but if all do so, prices fall
- Game theory helps analyze the stability of production agreements and predict outcomes

Example: Stackelberg Competition
In this model of sequential market entry, the first-mover (leader) has an advantage, influencing the decisions of followers. This applies to various business scenarios, such as product launches or capacity expansion decisions.
</application>

- Game theory helps in understanding the stability of deterrence and the risks of escalation

Example: Median Voter Theorem
This theorem suggests that in a majority rule voting system with single-peaked preferences, the median voter's preferred policy will be chosen. This has implications for political party positioning and policy choices.
</application>
