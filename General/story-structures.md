## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

This knowledge base document explores various storytelling structures and their applications in business contexts. Storytelling is a powerful tool for communication, persuasion, and engagement in both creative and professional settings. Understanding these structures can help business leaders, marketers, and communicators craft more effective narratives and presentations.

The document covers a range of storytelling frameworks, from classic literary structures to modern business-oriented approaches. Each section provides an overview of the structure, its context, and its potential business applications.

## 2. Chris Vogler's Hero's Journey <a name="chris-voglers-heros-journey"></a>

### Overview
Chris Vogler's Hero's Journey is a twelve-stage framework adapted from Joseph Campbell's monomyth concept. It was originally designed for screenwriters but has found applications in business storytelling.

### Context
Christopher Vogler was a Hollywood development executive and screenwriter working for Disney. He developed this framework to help incoming screenwriters and famously rewrote "The Lion King" as an adaptation of "Hamlet".

### Structure
The Hero's Journey is divided into three acts:

1. Act 1: Separation (Ordinary World)
2. Act 2: Descent and Initiation (Special World)
3. Act 3: Return and Climax (Ordinary World)

The twelve stages are:

1. Ordinary World
2. Call to Adventure
3. Refusal of the Call
4. Meeting the Mentor
5. Crossing the First Threshold
6. Tests, Allies, Enemies
7. Approach to the Innermost Cave
8. The Ordeal
9. Reward (Seizing the Sword)
10. The Road Back
11. Resurrection
12. Return with the Elixir

### Business Application
This framework is particularly useful for communicating complex enterprise-wide transformations. The Outer Journey can represent the external story (relevant for clients/customers), while the Inner Journey can represent the internal story (relevant for employees).

## 3. Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey <a name="joseph-campbells-heros-journey"></a>

### Overview
Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey is the original monomyth structure that inspired Vogler's adaptation. It consists of three basic stages and seventeen detailed steps.

### Context
Joseph Campbell first coined the term "Hero's Journey" in 1949 in his comparative mythology book "The Hero with a Thousand Faces". Campbell's work was influenced by Carl Jung's analytical psychology.

### Structure
The three main stages are:

1. Separation
2. Initiation
3. Return

The seventeen steps are:

1. Call to Adventure
2. Refusal of the Call
3. Supernatural Aid
4. Crossing the Threshold
5. Belly of the Whale
6. Road of Trials
7. Meeting with the Goddess
8. Woman as Temptress
9. Atonement with the Father
10. Apotheosis
11. The Ultimate Boon
12. Refusal of the Return
13. The Magic Flight
14. Rescue from Without
15. Crossing the Return Threshold
16. Master of Two Worlds
17. Freedom to Live

### Business Application
Campbell's approach is more analytical and theoretical compared to Vogler's. It could be suitable for a business story about an organization that needs to return to its core values after losing its way.

## 4. Dan Harmon's Story Circle <a name="dan-harmons-story-circle"></a>

### Overview
Dan Harmon's Story Circle is a simplified eight-step circular process derived from Joseph Campbell's structure.

### Context
Daniel James Harmon is an American screenwriter and producer best known as the creator of the NBC sitcom "Community" and "Rick & Morty". He developed this structure to help TV writers who struggled with plot creation.

### Structure
The eight steps of the Story Circle are:

1. Character (A character is in a zone of comfort)
2. Needs/Wants (But they want something)
3. Go (They enter an unfamiliar situation)
4. Search (And adapt to it)
5. Find (They get what they want)
6. Take (But there is a heavy price to pay)
7. Return (They return to their familiar situation)
8. Change (Having changed)

### Business Application
This simplified circular structure is suitable for regular client communications where building long-term relationships is the goal. It's particularly useful for TV writers who need to keep audiences coming back for years, which can be analogous to maintaining ongoing client relationships in business.

## 5. Donald Miller's StoryBrand <a name="donald-millers-storybrand"></a>

### Overview
The StoryBrand framework is a messaging tool created by marketer Donald Miller to help business leaders clarify their message and make it more customer-centric.

### Context
Donald Miller designed this 7-stage framework for his book "Building a StoryBrand". It's built on the premise that customers don't always buy the best products; they buy the products that communicate the clearest.

### Structure
The StoryBrand framework consists of seven stages:

1. A Character
2. Has a Problem
3. Meets a Guide
4. Who Gives Them a Plan
5. And Calls Them to Action
6. That Ends in Success
7. And Helps Them Avoid Failure

### Business Application
StoryBrand treats the customer as the hero ("a character") and focuses the story around the question "What problem are you solving?". This framework is ideal for client success stories and short presentations, encouraging business professionals to communicate how they'll solve the customer's problem in a structured, effective manner.

## 6. Nancy Duarte's Sparkline <a name="nancy-duartes-sparkline"></a>

### Overview
Nancy Duarte's Sparkline is a narrative device designed to help deliver compelling presentations through the use of contrast.

### Context
Nancy Duarte introduced this concept in her viral TED Talk "The Secret Structure of Great Talks" and her book "Resonate". She has used this framework to create presentations for notable figures like Steve Jobs, Marc Benioff, and Al Gore.

### Structure
The Sparkline alternates between:

- What is (the current situation)
- What could be (the envisioned future)

This structure creates a series of contrasts throughout the presentation, building tension and engagement.

### Business Application
Sparklines are highly effective for strategic communications, especially keynotes. They bring business presentations to life by creating contrast, from something as simple as a carefully placed "but" to painting a visionary picture of the status quo compared to where things could be.

## 7. Jeremy's Mission Critical Script <a name="jeremys-mission-critical-script"></a>

### Overview
Jeremy Connell-Waite created this simple 3-act structure as part of a "Tactical Communications" project to help business leaders communicate more effectively in mission-critical environments.

### Context
This structure was inspired by military OODA loops (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) and Duarte's Sparkline. It's designed for high-pressure, high-risk situations where effective communication is crucial.

### Structure
The Mission Critical Script consists of three acts:

1. Excite: What problem are you solving, why are you excited about it, and why should we care?
2. Disturb: What BIG obstacles and challenges stand in our way (and what would it mean if we overcame them)?
3. Assure: How can we work together to overcome these obstacles, why is this approach unique/differentiated, and why must we act with urgency?

### Business Application
This structure is particularly useful for winning hearts and minds and influencing boardroom executives, especially in situations where no slides will be shown. It helps quickly construct communications for C-level pitches and important conversations.

## 8. Blake Snyder's Save the Cat <a name="blake-snyders-save-the-cat"></a>

### Overview
"Save the Cat" is a screenwriting term coined by Blake Snyder, referring to a plot device where the protagonist does something admirable early in the story to establish them as likable.

### Context
Blake Snyder was a screenwriter who developed this method to provide a framework that most showrunners and screenwriters use when writing movies and TV shows.

### Structure
The Save the Cat method consists of 15 "beats":

1. Opening Image
2. Theme Stated
3. Setup
4. Catalyst
5. Debate
6. Break into Act 2
7. B Story
8. Fun and Games
9. Midpoint
10. Bad Guys Close In
11. All Is Lost
12. Dark Night of the Soul
13. Break into Act 3
14. Finale
15. Final Image

### Business Application
While this structure may seem over-engineered for a business story, it's ideal for seminars, workshops, or training programs. The "beats" are designed to keep an audience's attention for an extended amount of time (at least 1-2 hours), making it suitable for structuring a 90-minute workshop like a 90-minute movie.

## 9. Peter von Stackelberg's Pillars of Story Structure <a name="peter-von-stackelbergs-pillars-of-story-structure"></a>

### Overview
Peter von Stackelberg's work focuses on the fundamental elements that make up effective story structures across various media.

### Context
Peter von Stackelberg is a writer, award-winning investigative journalist, and Visiting Assistant Professor in Communication Studies at Alfred University. His research focuses on worldbuilding, story structure, and narrative design across digital media, books, films, graphic novels, and games.

### Structure
Von Stackelberg's approach emphasizes four key stages in character development:

1. Stage 1: The protagonist lives their "ordinary" life, largely unaware of their own weaknesses and flaws.
2. Stage 2: The protagonist is forced to leave their familiar life behind and face a new and unknown world with new challenges.
3. Stage 3: The protagonist begins to understand the nature of the antagonistic forces and starts to respond proactively.
4. Stage 4: The protagonist makes a critical, often difficult, choice that determines whether they have conquered their flaws and weaknesses.

### Business Application
Von Stackelberg's work encourages storytellers to select the correct structure for each story. In a business context, where many leaders don't use any structure at all when crafting their communications, this approach reminds us to at least have a structure and worry about whether it's the right one later.

## 10. Gustav Freytag's Pyramid <a name="gustav-freytags-pyramid"></a>

### Overview
Gustav Freytag's Pyramid is a narrative structure that breaks the story arc of a drama into five distinct sections.

### Context
Gustav Freytag was a 19th-century novelist and playwright who wanted to collate centuries of storytelling thinking into a simple structure. He codified the work of Greek dramatists and playwrights such as Shakespeare into a five-act narrative structure.

### Structure
Freytag's Pyramid consists of five parts:

1. Introduction
2. Rise
3. Climax
4. Return or Fall
5. Catastrophe

### Business Application
Freytag championed the importance of emotions in a story, without always needing to have a "conflict". Telling a story with back-to-back contrasting emotions is a useful framework business leaders can use to establish credibility when telling their own personal leadership stories.

## 11. Kurt Vonnegut's Story Structures <a name="kurt-vonneguts-story-structures"></a>

### Overview
Kurt Vonnegut, the author of "Slaughterhouse-Five", identified several common shapes that stories can take.

### Context
Vonnegut believed that ideas, and the convincing communication of those ideas to the reader, were vital to literary art. He once said, "There's no reason why the simple shapes of stories can't be fed into computers."

### Structure
Vonnegut identified several story shapes, including:

1. Man in Hole: Person exists, gets into trouble, gets out of trouble.
2. Boy Meets Girl: Person discovers something wonderful, loses it, gets it back again.
3. Cinderella: Person is in a dire situation, experiences good fortune, loses it all, then regains it all and more.
4. From Bad to Worse: Everything starts awful and progressively gets worse.

### Business Application
Vonnegut's approach encourages storytellers to never stop learning. In a business context, this means continually refining and adapting storytelling techniques to effectively communicate ideas and engage audiences.

## 12. The Scientific Method <a name="the-scientific-method"></a>

### Overview
The Scientific Method is an empirical approach to acquiring knowledge that has characterized the development of science since the 17th century.

### Context
While not officially a "story structure," the Scientific Method provides a valid framework for telling evidence and data-based stories, which can be particularly useful in business contexts.

### Structure
The Scientific Method typically follows these steps:

1. Problem
2. Research
3. Hypothesis
4. Experiment
5. Analysis
6. Conclusion

### Business Application
The scientific method is structured around unbiased testing because cognitive assumptions can distort the interpretation of observations. In business storytelling, this approach can be valuable for presenting data-driven narratives and avoiding cognitive biases that might skew the story.

## 13. Minto's Pyramid Principle <a name="mintos-pyramid-principle"></a>

### Overview
The Pyramid Principle is a storytelling tool designed to quickly and clearly communicate complex issues to busy business executives.

### Context
Barbara Minto, a McKinsey consultant, developed this principle in the 1970s. It literally flipped presentations on their head and is still widely recognized as the standard for communicating concepts and arguments in a logical, well-structured way.

### Structure
The Pyramid Principle structure:

1. Start with the answer (key message)
2. Group and summarize supporting arguments
3. Logically order supporting ideas
4. Provide supporting data

### Business Application
Minto's Pyramid was specifically designed for business communications. It starts at the end (with the proposed solution) and systematically works backward to carefully explain why the ending (the solution) works. This structure is ideal for presentations to busy executives when complex topics need to be communicated quickly and effectively.
