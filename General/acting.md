## 4. Core Theories and Principles

<theory name="Stanislavski System">
Developed by Konstantin Stanislavski, this system emphasizes psychological realism and emotional truth in acting. Key principles include:
- Emotional memory: Drawing on personal experiences to inform character emotions
- Given circumstances: Understanding the context in which a character exists
- Objective and super-objective: Identifying a character's immediate and overarching goals
- Method of physical actions: Using physical behavior to generate authentic emotions
</theory>

<theory name="Method Acting">
Evolved from the Stanislavski System, Method Acting was developed by Lee Strasberg and focuses on:
- Sense memory: Recalling sensory experiences to evoke genuine emotions
- Affective memory: Using personal emotional experiences to inform character emotions
- Substitution: Replacing a character's circumstances with personal analogous situations
- Relaxation: Techniques to release physical and mental tension
</theory>

<theory name="Meisner Technique">
Created by Sanford Meisner, this approach emphasizes:
- Repetition exercises: Developing the ability to listen and respond truthfully in the moment
- Emotional preparation: Using imagination to create a specific emotional state before a scene
- Independent activities: Performing tasks while engaging in dialogue to create natural behavior
- Improvisation: Spontaneous creation within the given circumstances of a scene
</theory>

<theory name="Brechtian Acting">
Developed by Bertolt Brecht, this approach focuses on:
- Alienation effect (Verfremdungseffekt): Preventing audience emotional identification with characters
- Gestus: Using physical gestures to convey social relationships and attitudes
- Breaking the fourth wall: Directly addressing the audience
- Episodic structure: Presenting scenes as separate, interconnected episodes rather than a continuous narrative
</theory>

<theory name="Viewpoints">
Developed by Mary Overlie and expanded by Anne Bogart and Tina Landau, Viewpoints is a technique for movement, gesture, and vocal work that explores:
- Spatial relationships
- Kinesthetic response
- Shape
- Tempo
- Duration
- Repetition
- Architecture
- Topography
- Gesture
</theory>

## 5. Critical Frameworks and Models

<framework name="Laban Movement Analysis">
Developed by Rudolf Laban, this framework analyzes movement in terms of:
- Body: What parts of the body are moving
- Effort: The quality of movement (Weight, Time, Space, Flow)
- Shape: How the body changes shape during movement
- Space: How the body moves through space
</framework>

<framework name="Chekhov Technique">
Created by Michael Chekhov, this approach focuses on:
- Psychological gesture: Using physical movements to express inner emotional states
- Atmosphere: Creating and responding to the mood of a scene
- Imagination: Developing vivid mental images to inform character and performance
- Incorporation: Embodying qualities or characteristics observed in others
</framework>

<framework name="Practical Aesthetics">
Developed by David Mamet and William H. Macy, this technique emphasizes:
- Script analysis: Breaking down the text to understand character objectives
- As-if: Relating the character's situation to the actor's personal experiences
- Action: Focusing on what the character is doing rather than feeling
- Moment-to-moment work: Responding truthfully to what's happening in the scene
</framework>

<model name="Stanislavski's Circle of Attention">
This model helps actors focus their concentration:
1. Small circle: Intimate focus on self or immediate surroundings
2. Medium circle: Awareness of the entire stage or set
3. Large circle: Extending attention to the entire theater or filming location
</model>

<model name="Uta Hagen's Nine Questions">
A set of questions actors use to analyze and develop their characters:
1. Who am I?
2. What time is it?
3. Where am I?
4. What surrounds me?
5. What are the given circumstances?
6. What is my relationship?
7. What do I want?
8. What is in my way?
9. What do I do to get what I want?
</model>
