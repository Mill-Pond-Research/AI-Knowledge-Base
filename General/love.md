## 4. Core Theories and Principles

<theories>
1. Triangular Theory of Love (Robert Sternberg, 1986):
   - Proposes that love has three components: intimacy, passion, and commitment
   - Different combinations of these components result in various types of love

2. Attachment Theory (John Bowlby, 1969):
   - Suggests that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape adult attachment styles
   - Identifies four adult attachment styles: secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant, and fearful-avoidant

3. The Five Love Languages (Gary Chapman, 1992):
   - Proposes that individuals express and receive love through five primary "languages":
     a. Words of Affirmation
     b. Acts of Service
     c. Receiving Gifts
     d. Quality Time
     e. Physical Touch

4. Social Exchange Theory (George Homans, 1958):
   - Applies economic principles to relationships, suggesting that people seek to maximize rewards and minimize costs in their interactions

5. Evolutionary Theory of Love:
   - Posits that love evolved as a mechanism to promote pair-bonding and ensure successful reproduction and child-rearing

6. Compassionate vs. Passionate Love (Elaine Hatfield, 1985):
   - Distinguishes between two types of love:
     a. Compassionate love: Deep affection and commitment
     b. Passionate love: Intense emotions and sexual attraction

7. Love as a Story (Robert Sternberg, 1995):
   - Proposes that individuals have internalized narratives or "love stories" that shape their expectations and behaviors in relationships
</theories>

<principles>
Key principles underlying the concept of love:

1. Reciprocity: The mutual exchange of emotional or physical affection
2. Trust: The belief in the reliability, truth, or ability of someone
3. Communication: The effective exchange of thoughts, feelings, and needs
4. Respect: Regard for the feelings, wishes, rights, or traditions of others
5. Forgiveness: The ability to let go of negative feelings and pardon offenses
6. Growth: The capacity for personal development within a loving relationship
7. Autonomy: Maintaining individual identity while being part of a couple
8. Commitment: Dedication to the relationship and its future
</principles>

## 5. Critical Frameworks and Models

     c. Storge (friendship-based love)
     d. Pragma (practical love)
     e. Mania (possessive, dependent love)
     f. Agape (selfless, altruistic love)

2. The Duplex Theory of Love (Robert Sternberg, 2006):

   - Suggests that love is both a structure (intimacy, passion, commitment) and a process (love stories)

3. The Prototype Model of Love (Beverley Fehr, 1988):
   - Proposes that people have a cognitive prototype or ideal concept of love
   - Individual experiences of love are compared to this prototype

4. The Biosocial Model of Status and Mating (Bugental, 2000):
   - Integrates evolutionary and social perspectives on love and mating
   - Considers how biological factors interact with social contexts to influence relationship formation

5. The Self-Expansion Model (Aron & Aron, 1986):
   - Suggests that individuals are motivated to expand their sense of self
   - Close relationships provide opportunities for rapid self-expansion

6. The Investment Model (Caryl Rusbult, 1980):

     a. Satisfaction level
     b. Quality of alternatives
     c. Investment size
